# Tensorflow_TTT_NN
Python TicTacToe game in which you can play against a supervised trained neuralnetwork.
The model of the network was build using tensorflow.
trainEVNN uses the NEAT-Algorithmen by Python-NEAT to train evNN to play TicTacToe by letting them play against each other.
The best eVNN plays against the surpervised NN of Tensorflow.
The project is placed in an anaconda enviroment.
